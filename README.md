# Save Restricted Bot

*A modern Telegram Bot to save and download restricted content, media stores, private posts, and channels with interactive previews.*

---

## Key Features

- **Save Restricted Content**: Download posts and media from restricted public/private channels, groups, and bot conversations.
- **Interactive Carousel / Slider Preview**: Browse multi-item batches with an image slider, item counter `[1/N]`, file size, filename, and Next / Previous pagination buttons.
- **Selective Batch Downloads**: Inspect FileStore / deep links before downloading. Download individual items selectively or download all with one click.
- **Deep Link & `/botmedia` Support**: Handles `https://t.me/BotUsername?start=batch_...` links seamlessly using user-session resolution.
- **Modern Transfer Progress UI**: Real-time progress bar dashboard with download speed, ETA, elapsed time, and thumbnail preview during transfer.
- **Completion Summary Cards**: Separate clean cards detailing completed file transfers, file sizes, and download/upload elapsed duration.
- **Custom Thumbnails & Captions**: Personalize your uploaded documents and videos with custom thumbnails and caption templates (`{filename}`, `{caption}`).
- **Self-Destruct / Auto-Delete Media**: Automatically deletes delivered media messages and completion cards after a customizable timer (defaults to **15 minutes**) with an advisory notice to preserve chat privacy and storage.
- **User Activity & Usage Analytics**: Built-in SQLite telemetry tracking user requests, files transferred, total network bandwidth, and media type breakdowns via `/users`, `/user <id>`, and `/myusage`.
- **Anti-Ban Protections**: Intelligent batch pacing, rate-limit backoffs, and invite-link cooldowns to protect user sessions from FloodWait.
- **System Diagnostics**: Built-in `/ping`, `/stats`, and `/status` monitoring CPU, RAM, disk, active tasks, and session health.

```

### Private channels / groups / restricted content
If the user session hasn't joined the target chat yet, send the invite link first:
```text
https://t.me/+invite_code
```
Then send the post link:
```text
https://t.me/c/123456789/123
```

### Bot chat messages & Deep Links

  ```text
  https://t.me/b/botusername/4321
  ```
- **Bot FileStore batch deep link**:
  ```text
  https://t.me/SnipyFileStore_iBot?start=batch_Z28Ltoo1
  ```
  *(Launches interactive preview slider with selective item download and preview cards)*
